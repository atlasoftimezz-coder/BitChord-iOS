/**
 * Beat and downbeat tracking with the Beat This! model (CPJKU, ISMIR 2024).
 *
 * Why a model at all: tempo and *meter* are different problems. Autocorrelation reads tempo well,
 * but nothing in an autocorrelation says which of four beats is beat one, and a mix that enters on
 * beat three sounds wrong even when every beat lines up.
 *
 * Beat This! is the one that can be shipped: both its code and its trained weights are MIT. Most
 * published MIR weights, Essentia's included, are CC BY-NC-SA.
 *
 * Everything here is optional. A missing model, an unreadable graph, a rate mismatch, too few
 * peaks, all resolve to null, and the caller keeps whatever it had. A missing beat tracker
 * degrades transitions; a throwing one would break playback.
